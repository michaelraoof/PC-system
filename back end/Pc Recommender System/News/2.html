            <p>
                AMD has patented a multi-core hybrid computing architecture that's somewhat analogous to Arm's big.LITTLE approach, or Intel's Lakefield chip. While by no means a confirmation of 
                what's to come from the red team, the patent suggests there's definitely some interest in pursuing a processor that mixes the best of both high-power and low-power computing all at once.
            </p>
            <p>
                We now live in an age where it's totally acceptable to stuff 10, 12, or 16 cores into a processor and call it a day. AMD and Intel are both at it as they wrestle for the multi-core 
                performance crown. Yet these chips are the antithesis of efficiency, and there's a need for some workloads to offer both hefty single-core performance without cranking up the power draw.

            </p>
            <p>
                Enter: the hybrid chip. It's an approach championed, or at least most widely utilised, under the big.LITTLE banner. This is a heterogeneous processing architecture laid out by Arm,
                whose 'big' processors are designed to do the computationally heavy work, while its 'LITTLE' processors are designed to take care of everything else with maximum power efficiency. 

            </p>

            <p>
                Intel has also followed suit with its Lakefield chip, an amalgamation of both a big Core core and a little Atom core, and is also expected to do so with its broader Alder Lake desktop architecture of the future.
            </p>

			<p>
				New patents dug out by user Underfox3 on Twitter, via freepatentsonline [PDF warning], suggest that AMD is at least considering a heterogeneous approach of its own. 
				The patent was first filed back in 2017, and so is only relatively new to us lot. Over at AMD it's likely been a consideration for R&D for some time. 
			</p>
			<p>
				
				The patent titled 'Instruction subset implementation for low power operation' is relatively basic. It outlines how two processors, one labelled 'high-feature' and 
				another labelled 'low-feature' would communicate and divvy up tasks between them for efficient operation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Three potential designs are outlined within the patent, and each one differs in cache configuration and shared registers. All possible outcomes share a similar goal,
				 however: when the low-power chip is over-utilised, the execution of a given thread is handed over to the high-performance chip.
			</p>
			<p>
				The patent specifically outlines the growing need for such a chip in mobile devices, in order to conserve battery life, and thus it's not expected to reach
				the desktop processor market anytime soon.

            <p>
                Intel Alder Lake will be a hybrid architecture, Intel confirms. The next-generation client processor architecture, expected to arrive in the second half of 2021 for both mobile and desktop, 
                will be a combination of two CPU architectures: Golden Cove and Gracemont. The aim is to provide an efficient answer for both high performance and high core-count processing for games and 
                productivity tasks. In short, this is Intel's answer to high core-count AMD Ryzen chips.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alder Lake as been rumoured to take a hybrid approach for some time, although confirmation has only come during Intel's latest Architecture Day 2020.
            </p>

            <p>
                So what does a hybrid architecture actually mean for us? That's a great question, because the hybrid architecture has usually, at least in its infancy, been used for battery-dependent mobile devices.
                Take a modern laptop: you want both performance when you need it, and superb battery life. To do that, you need a highly efficient processor, and one way of building
                such a chip is to use both low-power cores and high-power cores.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the core of a hybrid architecture is the idea that the low-power cores will do as much of the work as they can at a high level of efficiency. Once they are overloaded and literally 
                cannot deal with the workload, they shift that thread over to the high-performance core. These high-performance cores may not be as efficient, but they're quicker, more powerful,
                and only turned on when needed.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus a more power efficient chip is born.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's a technique Intel has used before with its Lakefield chip. That mobile-only architecture comprises just a single Sunny Cove Core core and four low-power Atom cores, and no
                HyperThreading. A recent patent by AMD suggests it's also looking at a similar approach, although a patent filing these days doesn't mean much.

            </p>
            <p>
                And that's why Intel's decision to load up a hybrid architecture on desktop (as confirmed in Intel's Q2 earnings call) had us stumped. It would allow it to claim 16 cores per chip—in the 
                eight Golden Cove, eight Gracemont configuration—but the power efficiency would have minimal impact on a wired up desktop machine.
